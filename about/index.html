        <p class="tipo about_game lng-about_me_text">I am an indie developer. I started my career with the Unity game engine and still write games on it. At the beginning of August 2024, I registered on the platform Itch.Io , where I still release games. My first game on the Itch platform, Secret Hideout, in the survival horror genre, took off in terms of views and downloads. I obviously didn't expect this. Then he released the Birdie game. It's a simple shooter, I got the idea from their Moorhuhn game. Then the second part of the shooter and the Big Road game were released. After the third part of the shooter, I started thinking about what to develop next. I'm currently working on a new horror game, because I realized that the most downloaded games are horror games with Android support.</p>
